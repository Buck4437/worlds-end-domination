todo: show base production of those buildings
todo: reorganize utils file

Convo from discord:
I might also add an upgrade that just multiplies the production of a building by e.g. x100
or 6 more upgrades that is based on total buildings, but multiplies a specific building

though I guess we can have 4 buildings to start with, and add an upgrade later in the game that unlocks the 5th and 6th ones

I also need a progression management class

1st Seal (Conquer)
2nd Seal (War)
3rd Seal (Famine)
4th Seal (Death)
5th ????
6th Seal: Sun, Moon, Stars, Terrain
7th Seal: Firestorm ===> 7 Trumpets
