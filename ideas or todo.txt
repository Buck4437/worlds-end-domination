refactor:
- spells 

todo: 
- tooltip
  -- Hide base and multiplier
- Add hotkeys for tab navigation
- Display current tab
- Saving
- toggle all for auto
- upgrade to remove the convert cooldown
- Don't use big list to display apocalypses, use another nav bar (e.g. vert) 

minghinshi said:
open worker 2 after buying worker 1
delete "max" 
unlock mana after worker 2 
warning when pressing prestige
change autobuy behaviour to have their own mode 

idea:
- Instead of capping mana, make some spells hv adverse impact on mana

Suggestions by minghinshi:
- Add stats for tracking time needed to complete each apocalypse

todo: Max buy next 10 
todo: reorganize utils file

Later nerf:
Change to all multi to always 1.5x => 10?????
