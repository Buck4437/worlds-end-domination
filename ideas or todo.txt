you look under the couch cushions
If an additional worker doesn’t break the game, you can probably start with it
or start with, like, 1/second

anyway hi I like the scaling so far
I feel like a ‘buy to next 10’ might be nice
Oh and a “buy max all”
You can probably increase the price of builders 2 considerably, because you basically start with merchants giving enough for it

1 worker/second?
real_rapid_jazz — Today at 23:30
1 money/second
or start with 1 worker

I kinda want the player to initiate the production of money to not confuse them
or I guess I can also make the first worker free
having 1 worker at the start certainly won't break the game though

nope
Starting with 2 money is also fine, but it does mean that if you alter the base costs of workers in the future, you need to alter starting money 
so ‘1 free worker’ is slightly safer


todo: show base production of those buildings
todo: reorganize utils file

Later nerf:
Change to all multi to always 2x => 10

Convo from discord:
I might also add an upgrade that just multiplies the production of a building by e.g. x100
or 6 more upgrades that is based on total buildings, but multiplies a specific building

though I guess we can have 4 buildings to start with, and add an upgrade later in the game that unlocks the 5th and 6th ones

I also need a progression management class

Section 1: Possibly a new prestige layer
1st Seal (Conquer)
2nd Seal (War)
3rd Seal (Famine)
4th Seal (Death)
5th ????
6th Seal: Sun, Moon, Stars, Terrain
7th Seal: Firestorm ===> 7 Trumpets
