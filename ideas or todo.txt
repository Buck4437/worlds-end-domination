Current idea for guilds:
- When you prestige, you gain one alliance (Threshold-based)
- Alliance boosts your coin production
- Milestone-based rewards based on alliance





Suggestions by minghinshi

Add stats for tracking time needed to complete each apocalypse

todo: show base production of those buildings [Via hover tooltip]
todo: reorganize utils file

Later nerf:
Change to all multi to always 1.5x => 10?????

Convo from discord:
I might also add an upgrade that just multiplies the production of a building by e.g. x100
or 6 more upgrades that is based on total buildings, but multiplies a specific building

though I guess we can have 4 buildings to start with, and add an upgrade later in the game that unlocks the 5th and 6th ones

























Section 1: Possibly a new prestige layer
1st Seal (Conquer)
2nd Seal (War)
3rd Seal (Famine)
4th Seal (Death)
5th ????
6th Seal: Sun, Moon, Stars, Terrain
7th Seal: Firestorm ===> 7 Trumpets
