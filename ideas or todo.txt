update() refactor progress:
Apocalypses Tab: not done
Automation Tab: done
Main Tab: not done
Mana Shop Tab: done
placeholders: not done
Combine all setInterval: not done

refactor mana shop upgrades to use objects as well

todo: 
- Change unfolding structure

- tooltip
  -- Hide base and multiplier
- Add hotkeys for tab navigation
- Display current tab
- Saving
- toggle all for auto
- upgrade to remove the convert cooldown
- Don't use big list to display apocalypses, use another nav bar (e.g. vert)

******unlock mana after worker 2 
delete "max" 
warning when pressing prestige
Remove progress bar for spell ?!?!?!?!?!?!? dold
Later reset can bank mana to generate more mana (Called Mana Bank)
change lv while spell activate

refactor:
- autobuy
- spells 

idea:
- Instead of capping spell count, make some spells hv adverse impact on mana

Suggestions by minghinshi:
- Add stats for tracking time needed to complete each apocalypse

todo: Max buy next 10 
todo: reorganize utils file

Later nerf:
Change to all multi to always 1.5x => 10?????
