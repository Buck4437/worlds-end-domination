refactor mana shop upgrades and apocalypses to use objects as well
maybe we can make upgrade reusable as well, idk

todo:
style confirmation tab and separate settings
- Saving

change lv while spell activate

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ideas for later:
- can collapse spells
- Add stats for tracking time needed to complete each apocalypse
- upgrade to remove the convert cooldown
- Don't use big list to display apocalypses, use another nav bar (e.g. vert) 
- Instead of capping spell count, make some spells hv adverse impact on mana
- Later reset can bank mana to generate more mana (Called Mana Bank)

Later nerf:
Change to all multi to always 1.5x => 10?????
